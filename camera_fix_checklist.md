# Camera Following Fix - Final Checklist

## Changes Made
1. Replaced the packed camera scene with a direct Camera2D node in main_game.tscn
2. Set the target_node_path to "../Player" in the scene file
3. Simplified the camera_controller.gd script to use direct position setting
4. Updated the _process method in main_game.gd to directly set camera position every frame

## Actions to Take in the Godot Editor
1. Open the project in Godot Editor
2. Open main_game.tscn
3. Check the MainCamera node:
   - Verify it has the camera_controller.gd script assigned
   - Verify target_node_path is set to "../Player"
   - If it's still a packed scene instance, delete it and add a new Camera2D with script

## Testing the Fix
1. Run the game directly from the main_game.tscn scene (right-click > Run Scene)
2. Watch the console for the "Camera controller initializing" message
3. Move the player and see if the camera follows exactly
4. If it still doesn't follow, try these additional approaches:
   - Edit main_game.gd to comment out any camera-related code in _ready
   - Try a completely new camera node with a new script that only contains:
     ```gdscript
     extends Camera2D
     
     func _process(_delta):
         var player = get_node("/root/MainGame/Player")
         if player:
             global_position = player.global_position
     ```

## Additional Diagnostics
- The debug print in the process method should show if the camera position is drifting
- If you see "WARNING: Camera distance from player" messages, the camera is not following correctly
- Check if any other scripts might be modifying the camera position
- Make sure there are no other Camera2D nodes in the scene that could be conflicting
