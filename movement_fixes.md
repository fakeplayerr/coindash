# Movement and Camera Fixes

## Problem Summary
After restructuring the project, the player movement and camera following functionality was broken. The camera would not properly follow the player, and the player movement felt incorrect, without the intended effect where the player moves forward while obstacles seem to move backward.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Player Movement - `src/characters/player/player.gd`
- Fixed the player's `_physics_process` function to ensure consistent forward movement
- Simplified the velocity calculation to always maintain forward speed
- Properly applied the handling multiplier to horizontal movement
- Corrected the car's rotation logic so it properly shows the car facing upward (-90 degrees)
- Allowed the player to move freely vertically (not clamped) so the camera could follow

### 2. Camera Controller - `src/gameplay/camera/camera_controller.gd`
- Improved the camera following logic to create the desired effect
- Made the camera follow the player's X position immediately for responsive horizontal movement
- Positioned the camera ahead of the player (-200 on Y axis) to show more of the road ahead
- Added debug output to help diagnose camera position issues
- Added immediate position updates when reconnecting to the player

### 3. Main Game Setup - `src/gameplay/main_game.gd`
- Enhanced camera initialization in the `_ready` function
- Explicitly set the camera's target to the player
- Positioned the camera ahead of the player for better visibility
- Added debug output to help track camera setup

### 4. Debug Tool - `src/debug_movement.gd` 
- Created a new diagnostic tool that can be attached to any scene
- Monitors and reports player position, velocity, and camera offset
- Helps to identify movement and camera following issues in real-time

## How to Test
1. Run the game from the main scene
2. Observe if the player moves forward continuously
3. Check if the camera follows the player properly, staying slightly ahead
4. Verify that obstacles appear to move backward as the player moves forward
5. Test horizontal movement to ensure the player can move left and right while continuing forward
6. Optional: Attach the debug tool to get detailed movement information

## Expected Behavior
- Player should move forward continuously and be able to steer left and right
- Camera should follow the player, staying slightly ahead to show more of the road
- The game should create the illusion of the player moving forward while the world moves backward
- The car should be visually oriented to face upward

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist:
1. Check the console for any error messages related to player or camera
2. Verify that the camera controller is properly linked in the scene
3. Try adjusting the Y offset in the camera controller for better visibility
4. Review the player's movement constants to ensure they're appropriate
