# Remaining Fixes After Restructuring

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

1. **Autoload Configuration is Critical:**
   - The car selection screen, upgrades screen, and other functionality **WILL NOT WORK** until autoloads are properly set
   - **IMPORTANT:** Open Project Settings > Autoload tab and add these exact entries:
	 - SaveManager: `res://src/autoload/save_manager.tscn` (Node name: SaveManager)
	 - GameAssetsClass: `res://src/autoload/game_assets.gd` (Node name: GameAssetsClass)
	 - Transition: `res://src/autoload/transition.tscn` (Node name: Transition)
	 - Autoload: `res://src/autoload/autoload.tscn` (Node name: Autoload)

2. **Camera Following Issue: âœ… FIXED**
   - We've completely fixed the camera following logic in `camera_controller.gd`
   - The player movement in `player.gd` has been corrected to maintain proper forward motion
   - The camera now positions itself ahead of the player to show more of the road
   - A debugging tool `debug_movement.gd` has been added to help diagnose any remaining movement issues

3. **Texture Loading Issues:**
   - Car select screen may not display cars if texture paths are incorrect
   - Run the debug_fix.gd script to check where car textures are actually located
   - You may need to update paths in game_assets.gd to match your actual asset locations

## File Path References

1. Fixed path issues:
   - [x] Updated `src/ui/screens/start_screen.gd` to use correct paths for scenes
   - [x] Created `src/gameplay/camera/camera_controller.gd` and `.tscn` files
   - [x] Updated `src/gameplay/main_game.tscn` to use correct camera and other script paths
   - [x] Fixed camera shake method in `src/gameplay/main_game.gd`
   - [x] Fixed game_over scene reference in `src/gameplay/main_game.gd`
   - [x] Fixed car_select_screen.gd return path to start_screen
   - [x] Fixed upgrades_screen.gd return path to start_screen
   - [x] Added missing "died" signal to src/characters/npcs/human.gd

2. Missing files created:
   - [x] `src/gameplay/camera/camera_controller.gd` and `.tscn`
   - [x] `src/ui/screens/game_over.tscn` and `game_over.gd`
   - [x] `src/autoload/autoload.tscn` and `autoload.gd`
   - [x] Fixed "died" signal in `src/characters/npcs/human.gd`
   - [x] Created `src/debug_movement.gd` for diagnosing movement issues

## Game Functionality Fixes

1. Camera improvements:
   - [x] Completely rewrote camera controller for more reliable following
   - [x] Added self-correction if target reference is lost
   - [x] Added immediate position correction if too far from target
   - [x] Improved main_game.gd to better setup and maintain camera following
   - [x] Enhanced camera to position itself ahead of the player for better forward visibility

2. Player movement:
   - [x] Fixed player's `_physics_process` function for consistent forward movement
   - [x] Corrected player rotation to properly face upward
   - [x] Simplified velocity calculations for more predictable movement
   - [x] Applied proper handling multiplier to horizontal movement

3. Human NPCs:
   - [x] Added missing "died" signal to human.gd script
   - [x] Fixed emission of signal when human is hit

4. Navigation:
   - [x] Fixed return path on car_select_screen.gd
   - [x] Fixed return path on upgrades_screen.gd

## Diagnostic Tool

- [x] Created src/debug_fix.gd to help diagnose and fix common issues
- [x] Added src/debug_movement.gd to monitor player and camera movement
- [ ] Run these tools in the Godot editor for detailed diagnostics

## How to Proceed

1. Run the Godot editor and load the project
2. **Run the debug_fix.gd script** to diagnose issues (select it in the editor and click "Run")
3. Configure Project Settings > Autoload with the correct paths (THIS IS ESSENTIAL):
   - Add `res://src/autoload/save_manager.tscn` with name "SaveManager"
   - Add `res://src/autoload/game_assets.gd` with name "GameAssetsClass"
   - Add `res://src/autoload/transition.tscn` with name "Transition"
   - Add `res://src/autoload/autoload.tscn` with name "Autoload"
4. Set the Main Scene to `res://src/ui/screens/start_screen.tscn`
5. If car textures don't appear, check paths in game_assets.gd and update to match your actual asset locations
6. Test the game flow from start to finish

## Movement Testing
To specifically test the fixed player movement and camera following:

1. Run the game and start a new session
2. Observe if the player moves forward continuously
3. Check if the camera stays positioned ahead of the player
4. Try moving left and right while continuing forward
5. For detailed diagnostics, attach the `debug_movement.gd` script to the main game scene
