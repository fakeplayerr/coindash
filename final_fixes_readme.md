# Final Fixes to Restore Functionality

After restructuring the project to use the `src/` directory, there were several issues that needed to be fixed:

## 1. Camera Following Issue

We've completely rewritten the camera controller to use direct following with no smoothing:
- Camera now directly sets its position to the player's position every frame
- Removed smoothing and interpolation which was causing the camera to lose the player
- Added direct NodePath reference to the Player node in the scene file

## 2. Car Selection and Upgrades Not Working

The root issue was the missing Autoload singleton. We've:
- Added the Autoload singleton to the project.godot file
- Made the autoload.gd script more robust with multiple fallbacks to find SaveManager
- Added a get_save_manager() helper function

## 3. Project Configuration

The project.godot file needs these autoloads configured:
```
[autoload]
Transition="*res://src/autoload/transition.tscn"
SaveManager="*res://src/autoload/save_manager.tscn"
GameAssetsClass="*res://src/autoload/game_assets.gd"
Autoload="*res://src/autoload/autoload.tscn"
```

## Required Manual Steps

1. After loading the project in Godot, go to Project > Project Settings > Autoload and verify:
   - SaveManager is set to res://src/autoload/save_manager.tscn with name SaveManager
   - GameAssetsClass is set to res://src/autoload/game_assets.gd with name GameAssetsClass
   - Transition is set to res://src/autoload/transition.tscn with name Transition
   - Autoload is set to res://src/autoload/autoload.tscn with name Autoload

2. Set the Main Scene to res://src/ui/screens/start_screen.tscn

3. Things to check if there are still issues:
   - In the console, look for "Autoload: Found SaveManager" message
   - If car textures don't load, check that the paths in game_assets.gd match your actual asset folder structure
   - The camera should now directly follow the player in main_game.tscn

## Technical Details of Fixes:

1. Camera controller (src/gameplay/camera/camera_controller.gd):
   - Now sets position directly without smoothing: `global_position = target.global_position`
   - Removed most of the complex behavior like smooth following

2. Main game (src/gameplay/main_game.gd):
   - Added proper Camera2D and CharacterBody2D variable declarations
   - Added direct camera position setting every frame
   - Added direct NodePath setting for the camera

3. Autoload system (src/autoload/autoload.gd):
   - Multiple delayed checks for finding SaveManager
   - Added alternate method to find SaveManager by searching all root nodes
   - Added helper function to get the SaveManager from any script

If you still have issues:
1. Run the game and check the Console for any error messages
2. Verify that the car textures exist in your assets folder at the path referenced in game_assets.gd
